# Send a weibo post without using API

Cons of using API: 

* Apply before using
* Characters are limited to 140 per post 

We can use it to automatically send weibo post with photos and videos. 

It is based on ***Python*** + ***Selenium*** + ***Chromium/Firefox*** and therefore should work for most platforms, including no-gui platform( with ***Xvfb***). I have tested it with ***Python 3.7.3*** on *macos 10.14.5*  and *Raspbian Buster Lite 4.19*.
